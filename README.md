# Monty-Hall-Problem-Simulation-

## Description
The Monty Hall Problem is a popular game show problem that utilises probability and has been debated for ages. The problem encompasses Bayesian Probability and Game Theory.
Small project regarding the monty hall problem. This was a personal project that I undertook as I had understood the math behind the monty hall problem, but I wanted to prove to myself that probability wise it would be the best option to switch doors.

I have managed to confirm the mathematical results that can be calculated analytically.

The project is done, but it may require small corrections in formality
